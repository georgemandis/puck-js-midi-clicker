# puck-js-midi-clicker
Use Puck.js as a BLE MIDI controller. Reacts to single, double and triple-clicks.

To start broadcasting a BLE MIDI signal that will allow your computer to pair with Puck.js as a MIDI device you have to triple click the device.

Sends CC values of 80 (single-click), 81 (double-click) and 82 (triple-click) on channel 10.

There are a million ways to repurpose this but I used mine to demonstrate non-musical MIDI applications as a slideshow clicker for [my presentation](https://speakerdeck.com/georgemandis).
